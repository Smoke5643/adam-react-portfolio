  ## Description of project
  
  This was my first attempt making a full ReactJS portfolio site from scratch. Coming from Handelbars this is a much better system in my opinion and can see why this library is in such high demand.  I plan to continue to update this after my coding bootcamp is over to include our final team project as well as any other project I do afterwards. I will admit the styling is rough right now but I have a feeling after class is over in 5 days I will have time to finish and polish it for job application needs.
